# Student-Performance-Linear-Regressor 
I came across the 'Student Performance' Dataset on Kaggle (link in README.md), which I wanted to explore a little. I came across a column called 'Performance Index' which is a weighted measure of the other columns. To figure out the formula which is used to calculate the column I ran it through a Linear Regression model. 

The results can be found in the overleaf document titled 'Findings' in this repo.
The Colab notebook with the fully functional code can also be found in the repo. For it to work, you'll need to upload the dataset to notebook before running the script.
