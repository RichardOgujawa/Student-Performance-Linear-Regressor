# Student Performance Linear Regressor 
I came across the 'Student Performance' Dataset on Kaggle (link in README.md), which I wanted to explore a little. I came across a column called 'Performance Index' which is a weighted measure of the other columns. To figure out the formula which is used to calculate the column I ran it through a Linear Regression model. 

The results can be found in the overleaf document titled 'Findings' in this repo.
The Colab notebook with the fully functional code can be found as a link down below. For it to work, you'll need to upload the dataset to notebook before running the script.
