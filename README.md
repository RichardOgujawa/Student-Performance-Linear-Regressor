# Student-Performance-Linear-Regressor
I came across the 'Student Performance' Dataset on Kaggle (link in README.md), which I wanted to explore a little. I came across a column called 'Performance Index' which is a weighted measure of the other columns. To figure out the formula which is used to calculate the column I ran it through a Linear Regression model.
